# Decoupled RPC Framework

Welcome to the Decoupled RPC Framework (DRPCF), a revolutionary Remote Procedure Call framework designed with a focus on decoupling, language independence, and seamless integration of diverse systems, including but not exclusively, Large Language Models (LLMs). DRPCF is built to support long-running tasks, metadata transmission (such as documentation or code definitions), and real-time streaming capabilities.

## Features

- **Language Agnostic**: Built on ZeroMQ (ZMQ) for universal language compatibility, ensuring the framework is accessible across various programming environments.
- **Distributed and Scalable**: Support for distributed computing, allowing plugins and components to run on different processes or machines connected through a stable network layer.
- **Dynamic Metadata Support**: Automatic parsing and availability of function/class metadata to the system, enriching the interaction and integration process.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Optimized for tasks of varying execution times, with immediate response for time estimates and support for real-time task updates.
- **Streaming Response**: Facilitates real-time data processing and interaction with support for streaming responses, ideal for continuous data flows.
- **Decoupling and Flexibility**: Designed for loose coupling, enabling components to join, leave, or be replaced without affecting the system's integrity.

## Getting Started

To embark on your journey with DRPCF, follow these essential steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fake/DRPCF.git
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   Refer to our [installation documentation](https://fake-docs/Installation) to set up your development environment tailored for DRPCF.

3. **Implement Your Plugins**:
   Use our decorators library to make your functions or classes easily discoverable and integrable with DRPCF. A detailed guide is available at [our decorators tutorial](https://fake-docs/Decorators).

4. **Launch the Framework**:
   Start the DRPCF core system by running:
   ```
   python core.py
   ```

5. **Connect and Deploy Plugins**:
   Get your plugins ready and connect them to DRPCF. For a step-by-step guide, visit the [plugin integration page](https://fake-docs/PluginIntegration).
